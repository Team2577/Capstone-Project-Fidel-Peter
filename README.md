Capstone Project for ETE
This project is part of the assessment required in completing the Mobile Applications  Module.

# Scenario
I want to develop an android app for a food delivery. When users open the app they will be able to select between restaurants and cuisines, once they select a cuisine the they would see a list of dishes (with a name of the dish, images, key ingredients and the price). When selecting the restaurant they would be able to see a list of dishes(or cuisines) offered by the restaurants. keep in mind that some restaurants may be having multiple cuisines on their menus. Add options for users to: 
1. Add the dish or restaurant to their favorites
2. Share the dish via different apps
### Note: Feel free to design it however you like, and use as much "covered in class" content as possible.
